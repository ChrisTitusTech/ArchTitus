This README contains the steps I do to install a base Arch Linux installation containing the bare minimum software (no gui)

---
## Create Arch ISO or Use Image

Download ArchISO from <https://archlinux.org/download/> and put on a USB drive with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html), or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)

If you don't want to build using this script I did create an image @ <https://www.christitus.com/arch-titus>

## Boot Arch ISO

From initial Prompt type the following commands:

```
pacman -Sy git
git clone -b server https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus
cd ArchTitus
./archtitus.sh
```

### System Description
This is completely automated base arch install using the bare minimum packages to have a functioning system. 

## Troubleshooting

__[Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://github.com/rickellis/Arch-Linux-Install-Guide)__

### No Wifi

You can check if the WiFi is blocked by running `rfkill list`.
If it says **Soft blocked: yes**, then run `rfkill unblock wifi`

After unblocking the WiFi, you can connect to it. Go through these 5 steps:

#1: Run `iwctl`

#2: Run `device list`, and find your device name.

#3: Run `station [device name] scan`

#4: Run `station [device name] get-networks`

#5: Find your network, and run `station [device name] connect [network name]`, enter your password and run `exit`. You can test if you have internet connection by running `ping google.com`, and then Press Ctrl and C to stop the ping test.
