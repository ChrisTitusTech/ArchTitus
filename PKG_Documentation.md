### LXDE Desktop Environment

LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment, featuring a classic interface reminiscent of older Windows versions.

### Openbox and Awesome

The following packages are only installed if the user selects either [Openbox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Openbox) or [Awesome](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Awesome) from within the desktop environment prompt during the installation process. Neither is a desktop environment *per se* but rather lightweight, powerful, and highly configurable windows manager. Both can run independently or within other integrated desktop environments (such as KDE and Xfce) as an alternative to the window managers they provide, although running Awesome independently is not really a user-friendly experience (it is primarily targeted at power users, developers and enthusiasts who want to have fine-grained control of their graphical environment).  
Openbox, however, provides a lightweight alternative to desktop environments while still offering a manageable user interface (as a matter of fact, the fast-performing LXDE desktop environment is built upon Openbox).

The package selection is almost identical for both window managers, with the exception of the package that installs the window manager itself:

* **[openbox](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/openbox/)**: Installs the Openbox window manager.
