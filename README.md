# ArchTitus Installer Script

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YiNMnan.png" />

This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional Arch Linux installation containing a desktop environment, all the support packages (network, bluetooth, audio, printers, etc.), along with all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)

## Create Arch ISO or Use Image

Download ArchISO from <https://archlinux.org/download/> and put on a USB drive with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html), or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)

If you don't want to build using this script I did create an image @ <https://www.christitus.com/arch-titus>

## Boot Arch ISO

From initial Prompt type the following commands:

```
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/BasedJam/ArchTitus
cd ArchTitus
./archtitus.sh
```

### System Description
This is completely automated arch install of the KDE desktop environment on arch using all the packages I use on a daily basis.

__[Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://github.com/rickellis/Arch-Linux-Install-Guide)__

### No Wifi

#1: Run `iwctl`

#2: Run `device list`, and find your device name.

#3: Run `station [device name] scan`

#4: Run `station [device name] get-networks`

#5: Find your network, and run `station [device name] connect [network name]`, enter your password and run `exit`. You can test if you have internet connection by running `ping google.com`.
