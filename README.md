# ArchTitus Installer Script

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YiNMnan.png" />

This README contains the steps I do to install and configure a fully-functional Arch Linux installation containing a desktop environment, all the support packages (network, bluetooth, audio, printers, etc.), along with all my preferred applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.)

## Create Arch ISO or Use Image

Download ArchISO from <https://archlinux.org/download/> and put on a USB drive with Ventoy or Etcher

If you don't want to build using this script I did create an image @ <https://www.christitus.com/arch-titus>

## Boot Arch ISO

From initial Prompt type the following commands:

```
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus
cd ArchTitus
./archtitus.sh
```
